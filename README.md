The behavioral and hormonal data used in this analysis will also be released on Figshare (DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.24085524) with detailed variable definitions and metadata. 

The analysis code files are numbered based on the order that they were run.



Additional code files that represent analyses that were not included in this publication are located in the "NotUsedInPaper" folder:

These analyses include:
1) Analyses of the ultrasonic vocalization data (which we eventually discovered was recorded incorrectly)
2) Detailed analyses of the open field habituation data (which we realized cannot be interpreted as usual in terms of exploration/anxiety because we used a non-standard protocol in which the rats were placed in the center at start of the test, so anxious animals tended to freeze there).
3) Analyses of the subset of animals that provided tissue for later proteoglycan immunocytochemistry analyses (separate publication, in prep).
